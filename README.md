# CHAT
This is a chat application that can be used for local usage in a small network. It creates a local server and people connected to the network can do a group or private chat. The chat also gives facilities to block someone from pinging unnecessarily.

Run MONGODB:
1. In CLI, $ cd C:/'Program Files'/MongoDB/Server/3.6/bin
2. $ ./mongod
3. Provided MONGODB is already installed on your PC, this should run mongo Server at port 27017

Run Server:
1. Clone this REPO here:
2. cd into Chat
3. $ npm install
4. $ npm test

Run Client:
1. If both of the above runs, go to localhost:8080
2. Voila the Chat App has created and works fine.

P.S:
Will improve UI and UX in the front-end and understand the functioning and try to optimize it as well.
